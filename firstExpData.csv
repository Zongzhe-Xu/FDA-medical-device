(i) specification of the criteria for test result interpretation and reporting.
(ii) information that demonstrates the performance characteristics of the device, including:
(a) accuracy (method comparison) of study results for each claimed specimen type.
(1 ) accuracy of the device shall be evaluated with fresh clinical specimens collected and processed in a manner consistent with the device's instructions for use. if this is impractical, fresh clinical samples may be substituted or supplemented with archived clinical samples. archived samples shall have been collected previously in accordance with the device's instructions for use, stored appropriately, and randomly selected. in some instances, use of contrived samples or human cell line samples may also be appropriate; the contrived or human cell line samples shall mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible and provide an unbiased evaluation of the device's accuracy.
(2 ) accuracy must be evaluated as compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda. performance criteria for both the comparator method and device must be predefined and appropriate to the test's intended use. detailed appropriate study protocols must be provided.
(3 ) information provided shall include the number and type of specimens, broken down by clinically relevant variants, that were compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda. the accuracy, defined as positive percent agreement (ppa) and negative percent agreement (npa), must be measured; accuracy point estimates must be greater than 99 percent (both per reported variant and overall) and uncertainty of the point estimate must be presented using the 95 percent confidence interval. clinical specimens must include both homozygous wild type and heterozygous genotypes. the number of clinical specimens for each variant reported that must be included in the accuracy study must be based on the variant prevalence. common variants (greater than 0.1 percent allele frequency in ethnically relevant population) must have at least 20 unique heterozygous clinical specimens tested. rare variants (less than or equal to 0.1 percent allele frequency in ethnically relevant population) shall have at least three unique mutant heterozygous specimens tested. any no calls (i.e.,
absence of a result) or invalid calls (e.g.,
failed quality control) in the study must be included in accuracy study results and reported separately. variants that have a point estimate for ppa or npa of less than 99 percent (incorrect test results as compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda) must not be incorporated into test claims and reports. accuracy measures generated from clinical specimens versus contrived samples or cell lines must be presented separately. results must be summarized and presented in tabular format, by sample and by genotype. point estimate of ppa should be calculated as the number of positive results divided by the number of specimens known to harbor variants (mutations) without ""no calls"" or invalid calls. the point estimate of npa should be calculated as the number of negative results divided by the number of wild type specimens tested without ""no calls"" or invalid calls, for each variant that is being reported. point estimates should be calculated along with 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals.
(4 ) information shall be reported on the clinical positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) for carrier status (and where possible, for each variant) in each population. specifically, to calculate ppv and npv, estimate test coverage (tc) and the percent of persons with variant(s) included in the device among all carriers: ppv = (ppa * tc * ï?)/(ppa * tc * ï? + (1 â?? npa) * (1 â?? ï?)) and npv = (npa * (1 â?? ï?))/(npa *(1 â?? ï?) + (1 â?? ppa*tc) * ï?) where ppa and npa described either in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(a)(4 )(i ) or in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(a)(4 )(ii ) of this section and ï? is prevalence of carriers in the population (pre-test risk to be a carrier for the disease).

(i) specification of the criteria for test result interpretation and reporting.
(j) information that demonstrates the performance characteristics of the test, including:
(1 ) accuracy of study results for each claimed specimen type.
(i ) accuracy of the test shall be evaluated with fresh clinical specimens collected and processed in a manner consistent with the test's instructions for use. if this is impractical, fresh clinical samples may be substituted or supplemented with archived clinical samples. archived samples shall have been collected previously in accordance with the instructions for use, stored appropriately, and randomly selected. in some limited circumstances, use of contrived samples or human cell line samples may also be appropriate and used as an acceptable alternative. the contrived or human cell line samples shall mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible and provide an unbiased evaluation of the device accuracy.
(ii ) accuracy must be evaluated by comparison to bidirectional sanger sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda. performance criteria for both the comparator method and the device must be predefined and appropriate to the device's intended use. detailed study protocols must be provided.
(iii ) test specimens must include all genotypes that will be included in the tests and reports. the number of samples tested in the accuracy study for each variant reported must be based on the variant frequency using either the minimum numbers of samples identified in this paragraph or, when determined appropriate and identified by fda, a minimum number of samples determined using an alternative method. when appropriate, the same samples may be used in testing to demonstrate the accuracy of testing for multiple genotypes by generating sequence information at multiple relevant genetic locations. at least 20 unique samples representing the wild-type genotype must be tested. to test samples that are heterozygous for the reported variant(s), common variants (>0.1 percent variant frequency in the relevant population) must be tested with at least 20 unique samples. rare variants (â?¤0.1 percent variant frequency in the relevant population) must be tested with at least three unique samples. to test samples that are homozygous for the reported variant(s), variants with â?¥2 percent variant frequency in a relevant population must be tested with at least 20 unique samples. variants with a frequency in the relevant population <2 percent and â?¥0.5 percent must be tested with at least 10 unique samples. variants with a frequency in the relevant population <0.5 percent must be tested with at least three unique samples. if variants with a frequency of <0.5 percent are not found within the relevant population and homozygous samples are not tested, then the test results for this homozygous rare variant must not be reported to the user.
(iv ) information about the accuracy study shall include the number and type of samples that were compared to bidirectional sanger sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda. this information must either be reported in tabular format and arranged by clinically relevant variants or reported using another method identified as appropriate by fda. as an example, for samples with different genotypes dd, dd, and dd, the following table represents data from the accuracy study presented in tabular format:
(v ) the accuracy represents the degrees of agreement between the device results and the comparator results. the accuracy must be evaluated by measuring different percent agreements (pa) of device results with the comparator results and percent of `no calls' or `invalid calls.' calculate the rate of `no calls' and `invalid calls' for each comparator output as %inv(dd) = a4/ndd, %inv(dd) = b4/ndd, %inv(dd) = c4/ndd. if `no calls' or `invalid calls' are required to be retested according to the device instructions for use, the percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be provided. in the table presenting the results of the accuracy study, use only the final results (i.e.,
after retesting the initial `no calls' or `invalid calls', if required according to the instructions for use). samples that resulted in a `no call' or `invalid call' after retesting must not be included in the final calculations of agreement. if the percentages of `no calls' or `invalid calls' for each comparator output are similar, combine these estimates as (a4 + b4 + c4)/(ndd + ndd + ndd) and provide a 95 percent two-sided confidence interval. the percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be clinically acceptable.
(vi ) point estimates of percent agreement for each genotype must be calculated as the number of correct calls for that genotype divided by the number of samples known to contain that genotype excluding `no calls' or `invalid calls'. the calculations must be performed as follows:
(vii ) for percent agreements for dd, dd and dd (pa(dd|dd), pa(dd|dd) and pa(dd|dd)) as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(vi ) of this section, the 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals must be provided. the accuracy point estimates for percent agreements for dd, dd and dd must be â?¥99 percent per reported variant and overall. any variants that have a point estimate for either pa(dd|dd), pa(dd|dd), or pa(dd|dd) of <99 percent compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda must not be incorporated into test claims and reports. accuracy results generated from clinical specimens versus contrived samples or cell lines must be presented separately. results must be summarized and presented in tabular format by sample type and by genotype or must be reported using another method identified as appropriate by fda (see paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(iv ) of this section).
(viii ) information must be reported on the technical positive predictive value (tppv) related to the analytical (technical) performance of the device for genotypes in each relevant subpopulation (e.g.,
ethnicity, gender, age, geographical location, etc.). tppv is the percentage of individuals with the genotype truly present among individuals whose test reports indicate that this genotype is present. the tppv depends on the accuracy measures of percent agreements and on the frequency of the genotypes in the subpopulation being studied. the f(dd) is the frequency of dd and f(dd) is the frequency of dd in the subpopulation being studied; tppv must be calculated as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(ix ) through (xi ) of this section.
(ix ) for variants where the point estimates of pa(dd|dd), pa(dd|dd) and pa(dd|dd) are less than 100 percent, use these point estimates in tppv calculations.
(x ) point estimates of 100 percent in the accuracy study may have high uncertainty about performance of the test in the population. if these variants are measured using highly multiplexed technology, calculate the random error rate for the overall device. the accuracy study described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j) of this section in those cases is more to determine that there is no systematic error in such devices. in those cases, incorporate that rate in the estimation of the percent agreements as calculated in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(vi ) of this section and include it in tppv calculations.
(xi ) the tppv for subpopulations with genotype frequencies of f(dd), f(dd) and f(dd) = 1â??f(dd)â??f(dd) in the subpopulation is calculated as:
(2 ) precision and reproducibility data must be provided using multiple instruments and multiple operators, on multiple non-consecutive days, and using multiple reagent lots. the sample panel must either include specimens from the claimed sample type (e.g.,
saliva) representing all genotypes for each variant (e.g.,
wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous) or, if an alternative panel composition of specimens is identified by fda as appropriate, a panel composed of those specimens fda identified as appropriate. a detailed study protocol must be created in advance of the study and must include predetermined acceptance criteria for performance results. the percentage of samples that failed quality control must be indicated (i.e.,
the total number of sample replicates for which a sequence variant cannot be called (no calls) or that fail sequencing quality control criteria divided by the total number of replicates tested). it must be clearly documented whether results were generated from clinical specimens, contrived samples, or cell lines. the study results shall report the variants tested in the study and the number of replicates for each variant, and what conditions were tested (i.e.,
number of runs, days, instruments, reagent lots, operators, specimens/type, etc.). results must be evaluated and presented in tabular format and stratified by study parameter (e.g.,
by site, instrument(s), reagent lot, operator, and sample variant). the study must include all extraction steps from the claimed specimen type or matrix, unless a separate extraction reproducibility study for the claimed sample type is performed. if the device is to be used at more than one laboratory, different laboratories must be included in the reproducibility study and reproducibility across sites must be evaluated. any no calls or invalid calls in the study must be listed as a part of the precision and reproducibility study results.
(3 ) analytical specificity data:
data must be provided that evaluates the effect of potential endogenous and exogenous interferents on test performance, including specimen extraction and variant detection. interferents tested must include those reasonably likely to be potentially relevant to the sample type used for the device.
(4 ) interfering variant data:
nucleotide mutations that can interfere with the technology must be cited and evaluated. data must be provided to demonstrate the effect of the interfering variant(s) on the performance of the correct calls. alternatively, for each suspected interfering mutation for which data is not provided demonstrating the effect of the interfering variant, the manufacturer must identify the suspected interfering variants in the labeling and indicate that the impact that the interfering variants may have on the assay's performance has not been studied by providing a statement that reads ""it is possible that the presence of [insert clearly identifying information for the suspected interfering variant] in a sample may interfere with the performance of this test. however, its effect on the performance of this test has not been studied.""
(5 ) analytical sensitivity data:
data must be provided demonstrating the minimum amount of dna that will enable the test to perform correctly in 95 percent of runs.
(6 ) reagent stability:
the manufacturer must evaluate reagent stability using wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous samples. reagent stability data must demonstrate that the reagents maintain the claimed accuracy and reproducibility. data supporting such claims must be provided.
(7 ) specimen type and matrix comparison data:
specimen type and matrix comparison data must be generated if more than one specimen type can be tested with this device, including failure rates for the different specimens.
(k) clinical performance summary.
(1 ) information to support the clinical performance of each variant reported by the test must be provided.
(2 ) manufacturers must organize information by the specific variant combination as appropriate (e.g.,
wild type, heterozygous, homozygous, compound heterozygous, hemizygous genotypes). for each variant combination, information must be provided in the clinical performance section to support clinical performance for the risk category (e.g.,
not at risk, increased risk). for each variant combination, a summary of key results must be provided in tabular format or using another method identified as appropriate by fda to include the appropriate information regarding variant type, data source, definition of the target condition (e.g.,
disease), clinical criteria for determining whether the target disease is present or absent, description of subjects with the target disease present and target disease absent (exclusion or inclusion criteria), and technical method for genotyping. when available, information on the effect of the variant on risk must be provided as the risk of a disease (lifetime risk or lifetime incidences) for an individual compared with the general population risk.
(i ) if odds ratios are available, using information about the genotype distribution either among individuals with the target disease absent, or in the general population, or information about the risk variant frequency and odds ratios, the likelihood ratios for the corresponding device results along with 95 percent confidence intervals must be calculated. using information about pretest risk (ï?), an estimate of likelihood ratio (lr), and a relationship between post-test risk r as r/(1â??r) = lr-ï?/(1â??ï?), the post-test risk r must be calculated.
(ii ) when available, likelihood ratios (lr) for different test results must be presented in a tabular format along with references to the source data or using another method identified as appropriate by fda as stated in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(k)(2) of this section. when these values are not directly available in published literature, likelihood ratios can be separately calculated along with the 95 percent confidence interval with references to the source data. note that a minimum requirement for the presence of the variant's effect on the risk is that a corresponding lr is statistically higher than 1 (a lower bound of 95 percent two-sided confidence interval is larger than 1). it means that the post-test risk is statistically higher than the pretest risk (an observed value of the difference between the post-test and pretest risks).

(i ) for the point estimates of ppa and npa less than 100 percent, use the calculated estimates in the ppv and npv calculations.
(ii ) point estimates of 100 percent may have high uncertainty. if these variants are measured using highly multiplexed technology, calculate the random error rate for the overall device and incorporate that rate in the estimation of the ppa and npa as calculated previously. then use these calculated estimates in the ppv and npv calculations. this type of accuracy study is helpful in determining that there is no systematic error in such devices.
(b) precision (reproducibility): precision data must be generated using multiple instruments and multiple operators, on multiple non-consecutive days, and using multiple reagent lots. the sample panel must include specimens with claimed sample type (e.g.

number of runs, days, instruments, reagent lots, operators, specimens/type, etc). the study must include all nucleic acid extraction steps from the claimed specimen type or matrix, unless a separate extraction study for the claimed sample type is performed. if the device is to be used at more than one laboratory, different laboratories must be included in the precision study (and reproducibility must be evaluated). the percentage of ""no calls"" or invalid calls, if any, in the study must be provided as a part of the precision (reproducibility) study results.
(c) analytical specificity data: data must be generated evaluating the effect on test performance of potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances relevant to the specimen type, evaluation of cross-reactivity of known cross-reactive alleles and pseudogenes, and assessment of cross-contamination.
(d) analytical sensitivity data: data must be generated demonstrating the minimum amount of dna that will enable the test to perform accurately in 95 percent of runs.

(f) specimen type and matrix comparison data: specimen type and matrix comparison data must be generated if more than one specimen type or anticoagulant can be tested with the device, including failure rates for the different specimen types.
(iii) if the device is offered over-the-counter, including cases in which the test results are provided direct-to-consumer, the manufacturer must conduct a study that assesses user comprehension of the device's labeling and test process and provide a concise summary of the results of the study. the following items must be included in the user study:

(i) specification of the criteria for test result interpretation and reporting.
(j) information that demonstrates the performance characteristics of the test, including:
(1 ) accuracy of study results for each claimed specimen type.
(i ) accuracy of the test shall be evaluated with fresh clinical specimens collected and processed in a manner consistent with the test's instructions for use. if this is impractical, fresh clinical samples may be substituted or supplemented with archived clinical samples. archived samples shall have been collected previously in accordance with the instructions for use, stored appropriately, and randomly selected. in some limited circumstances, use of contrived samples or human cell line samples may also be appropriate and used as an acceptable alternative. the contrived or human cell line samples shall mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible and provide an unbiased evaluation of the device accuracy.
(ii ) accuracy must be evaluated by comparison to bidirectional sanger sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda. performance criteria for both the comparator method and the device must be predefined and appropriate to the device's intended use. detailed study protocols must be provided.
(iii ) test specimens must include all genotypes that will be included in the tests and reports. the number of samples tested in the accuracy study for each variant reported must be based on the variant frequency using either the minimum numbers of samples identified in this paragraph or, when determined appropriate and identified by fda, a minimum number of samples determined using an alternative method. when appropriate, the same samples may be used in testing to demonstrate the accuracy of testing for multiple genotypes by generating sequence information at multiple relevant genetic locations. at least 20 unique samples representing the wild-type genotype must be tested. to test samples that are heterozygous for the reported variant(s), common variants (>0.1 percent variant frequency in the relevant population) must be tested with at least 20 unique samples. rare variants (â?¤0.1 percent variant frequency in the relevant population) must be tested with at least three unique samples. to test samples that are homozygous for the reported variant(s), variants with â?¥2 percent variant frequency in a relevant population must be tested with at least 20 unique samples. variants with a frequency in the relevant population <2 percent and â?¥0.5 percent must be tested with at least 10 unique samples. variants with a frequency in the relevant population <0.5 percent must be tested with at least three unique samples. if variants with a frequency of <0.5 percent are not found within the relevant population and homozygous samples are not tested, then the test results for this homozygous rare variant must not be reported to the user.
(iv ) information about the accuracy study shall include the number and type of samples that were compared to bidirectional sanger sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda. this information must either be reported in tabular format and arranged by clinically relevant variants or reported using another method identified as appropriate by fda. as an example, for samples with different genotypes dd, dd, and dd, the following table represents data from the accuracy study presented in tabular format:
(v ) the accuracy represents the degrees of agreement between the device results and the comparator results. the accuracy must be evaluated by measuring different percent agreements (pa) of device results with the comparator results and percent of `no calls' or `invalid calls.' calculate the rate of `no calls' and `invalid calls' for each comparator output as %inv(dd) = a4/ndd, %inv(dd) = b4/ndd, %inv(dd) = c4/ndd. if `no calls' or `invalid calls' are required to be retested according to the device instructions for use, the percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be provided. in the table presenting the results of the accuracy study, use only the final results (i.e.,
after retesting the initial `no calls' or `invalid calls', if required according to the instructions for use). samples that resulted in a `no call' or `invalid call' after retesting must not be included in the final calculations of agreement. if the percentages of `no calls' or `invalid calls' for each comparator output are similar, combine these estimates as (a4 + b4 + c4)/(ndd + ndd + ndd) and provide a 95 percent two-sided confidence interval. the percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be clinically acceptable.
(vi ) point estimates of percent agreement for each genotype must be calculated as the number of correct calls for that genotype divided by the number of samples known to contain that genotype excluding `no calls' or `invalid calls'. the calculations must be performed as follows:
(vii ) for percent agreements for dd, dd and dd (pa(dd|dd), pa(dd|dd) and pa(dd|dd)) as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(vi ) of this section, the 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals must be provided. the accuracy point estimates for percent agreements for dd, dd and dd must be â?¥99 percent per reported variant and overall. any variants that have a point estimate for either pa(dd|dd), pa(dd|dd), or pa(dd|dd) of <99 percent compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by fda must not be incorporated into test claims and reports. accuracy results generated from clinical specimens versus contrived samples or cell lines must be presented separately. results must be summarized and presented in tabular format by sample type and by genotype or must be reported using another method identified as appropriate by fda (see paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(iv ) of this section).
(viii ) information must be reported on the technical positive predictive value (tppv) related to the analytical (technical) performance of the device for genotypes in each relevant subpopulation (e.g.,
ethnicity, gender, age, geographical location, etc.). tppv is the percentage of individuals with the genotype truly present among individuals whose test reports indicate that this genotype is present. the tppv depends on the accuracy measures of percent agreements and on the frequency of the genotypes in the subpopulation being studied. the f(dd) is the frequency of dd and f(dd) is the frequency of dd in the subpopulation being studied; tppv must be calculated as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(ix ) through (xi ) of this section.
(ix ) for variants where the point estimates of pa(dd|dd), pa(dd|dd) and pa(dd|dd) are less than 100 percent, use these point estimates in tppv calculations.
(x ) point estimates of 100 percent in the accuracy study may have high uncertainty about performance of the test in the population. if these variants are measured using highly multiplexed technology, calculate the random error rate for the overall device. the accuracy study described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j) of this section in those cases is more to determine that there is no systematic error in such devices. in those cases, incorporate that rate in the estimation of the percent agreements as calculated in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(j)(1 )(vi ) of this section and include it in tppv calculations.
(xi ) the tppv for subpopulations with genotype frequencies of f(dd), f(dd) and f(dd) = 1â??f(dd)â??f(dd) in the subpopulation is calculated as:
(2 ) precision and reproducibility data must be provided using multiple instruments and multiple operators, on multiple non-consecutive days, and using multiple reagent lots. the sample panel must either include specimens from the claimed sample type (e.g.,
saliva) representing all genotypes for each variant (e.g.,
wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous) or, if an alternative panel composition of specimens is identified by fda as appropriate, a panel composed of those specimens fda identified as appropriate. a detailed study protocol must be created in advance of the study and must include predetermined acceptance criteria for performance results. the percentage of samples that failed quality control must be indicated (i.e.,
the total number of sample replicates for which a sequence variant cannot be called (no calls) or that fail sequencing quality control criteria divided by the total number of replicates tested). it must be clearly documented whether results were generated from clinical specimens, contrived samples, or cell lines. the study results shall report the variants tested in the study and the number of replicates for each variant, and what conditions were tested (i.e.,
number of runs, days, instruments, reagent lots, operators, specimens/type, etc.). results must be evaluated and presented in tabular format and stratified by study parameter (e.g.,
by site, instrument(s), reagent lot, operator, and sample variant). the study must include all extraction steps from the claimed specimen type or matrix, unless a separate extraction reproducibility study for the claimed sample type is performed. if the device is to be used at more than one laboratory, different laboratories must be included in the reproducibility study and reproducibility across sites must be evaluated. any no calls or invalid calls in the study must be listed as a part of the precision and reproducibility study results.
(3 ) analytical specificity data:
data must be provided that evaluates the effect of potential endogenous and exogenous interferents on test performance, including specimen extraction and variant detection. interferents tested must include those reasonably likely to be potentially relevant to the sample type used for the device.
(4 ) interfering variant data:
nucleotide mutations that can interfere with the technology must be cited and evaluated. data must be provided to demonstrate the effect of the interfering variant(s) on the performance of the correct calls. alternatively, for each suspected interfering mutation for which data is not provided demonstrating the effect of the interfering variant, the manufacturer must identify the suspected interfering variants in the labeling and indicate that the impact that the interfering variants may have on the assay's performance has not been studied by providing a statement that reads ""it is possible that the presence of [insert clearly identifying information for the suspected interfering variant] in a sample may interfere with the performance of this test. however, its effect on the performance of this test has not been studied.""
(5 ) analytical sensitivity data:
data must be provided demonstrating the minimum amount of dna that will enable the test to perform correctly in 95 percent of runs.
(6 ) reagent stability:
the manufacturer must evaluate reagent stability using wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous samples. reagent stability data must demonstrate that the reagents maintain the claimed accuracy and reproducibility. data supporting such claims must be provided.
(7 ) specimen type and matrix comparison data:
specimen type and matrix comparison data must be generated if more than one specimen type can be tested with this device, including failure rates for the different specimens.
(k) clinical performance summary.
(1 ) information to support the clinical performance of each variant reported by the test must be provided.
(2 ) manufacturers must organize information by the specific variant combination as appropriate (e.g.,
wild type, heterozygous, homozygous, compound heterozygous, hemizygous genotypes). for each variant combination, information must be provided in the clinical performance section to support clinical performance for the risk category (e.g.,
not at risk, increased risk). for each variant combination, a summary of key results must be provided in tabular format or using another method identified as appropriate by fda to include the appropriate information regarding variant type, data source, definition of the target condition (e.g.,
disease), clinical criteria for determining whether the target disease is present or absent, description of subjects with the target disease present and target disease absent (exclusion or inclusion criteria), and technical method for genotyping. when available, information on the effect of the variant on risk must be provided as the risk of a disease (lifetime risk or lifetime incidences) for an individual compared with the general population risk.
(i ) if odds ratios are available, using information about the genotype distribution either among individuals with the target disease absent, or in the general population, or information about the risk variant frequency and odds ratios, the likelihood ratios for the corresponding device results along with 95 percent confidence intervals must be calculated. using information about pretest risk (ï?), an estimate of likelihood ratio (lr), and a relationship between post-test risk r as r/(1â??r) = lr-ï?/(1â??ï?), the post-test risk r must be calculated.
(ii ) when available, likelihood ratios (lr) for different test results must be presented in a tabular format along with references to the source data or using another method identified as appropriate by fda as stated in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(k)(2) of this section. when these values are not directly available in published literature, likelihood ratios can be separately calculated along with the 95 percent confidence interval with references to the source data. note that a minimum requirement for the presence of the variant's effect on the risk is that a corresponding lr is statistically higher than 1 (a lower bound of 95 percent two-sided confidence interval is larger than 1). it means that the post-test risk is statistically higher than the pretest risk (an observed value of the difference between the post-test and pretest risks).
